    'You step into the room, and your eyes settle on the table in the center. It looks ancient and ornate, with carvings of fantastical creatures etched into its surface. Three weapons are laid out on it, gleaming in the dim light. Each one looks different, but all three seem to choose you, beckoning you to select one of them. The room is silent, and the air is charged with anticipation, as if the weapons are daring you to make your choice. ',
